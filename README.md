# TUIO.touch.js
## Implementing TUIO interactions into javascript

This implementation builds upon the <a href="https://github.com/fajran/npTuioClient">npTuioClient</a> plugin and library.

The goal is to handle basic interactions (tap, double, tap, drag, rotate) and basic gestures (swipe, pinch).

The current stage is very early. So don't rely on the structure until we add a proper version number to it.
